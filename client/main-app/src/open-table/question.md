2. useEffect and useState
const [filteredData, setFilteredData] = useState([]);
useEffect(() => {
    setFilteredData(filterByKeyword(restaurants,keyword));
  }, [keyword,restaurants]);

3. Talk to the PO to know better about the issue, track the workflow from database -> middleware-> frontend. Yes I have done this before.
